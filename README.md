## Amplify CLI

#### Install the Amplify CLI

```bash
  npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

#### Configure the Amplify CLI

```bash
  amplify configure
```

`amplify configure` will ask you to sign into the AWS Console and ask for a new user creation. Once the user is created, Amplify CLI will ask you to provide the `accessKeyId` and the `secretAccessKey` to connect Amplify CLI with your newly created IAM user.

```bash
Enter the access key of the newly created user:
? accessKeyId:  # YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
? secretAccessKey:  # YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
This would update/create the AWS Profile in your local machine
? Profile Name:  # (default)

Successfully set up the new user.
```

#### Initialize Amplify CLI

After you install the CLI, navigate to a JavaScript, iOS, or Android project root, initialize AWS Amplify in the new directory by running `amplify init`. After a few configuration questions, you can use amplify help at any time to see the overall command structure. When youâ€™re ready to add a feature, run amplify add <category>.

```bash
  amplify init
```
